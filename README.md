# Gaussian Elimination

This project allows you to (theoretically) solve systems of N x N linear equations. There are several limitations to this implementation: it has not been thoroughly tested so it may just not work. I will be updating this in the future to make it much more rigourous, and outline fully exactly what it can and cannot do.
